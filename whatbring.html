    <li>meals: bring a dish for Friday night to share with everyone, we are doing a potluck dinner.  On Saturday night we will be cooking FNB style dhal and rice but also last year we had a great amount of leftovers from the potluck. We really loved that and it would be cool to see that happen again. Bring a bunch for Friday and we'll feast again.</li>
    <li>extra food info: there's a decent kitchen but we can't all have big meals there. It can work if we're chill with each other making coffee, snacks and whatnot. There's a pie warmer if you wanna bring stuff. Fridge space will be mostly taken up with potluck so please bring chilli-bins and ice for your drinks and other shit, don't expect fridge space. There's also an outdoor electric BBQ you can go crazy on. Klean after use!</li>
    <li>bin bags (take trash back home with you).</li>
    <li>ice box (with ice to share).</li>

Who are you? Meaning us, who&apos;re doing this.

<h3 class="paragraph">
What is F.U.C.K Camp?
<br>
<br>
We&apos;re a bunch of queers who love festivals, love to party, and want to make all that shit affordable and grassroots. We&apos;re a crew of people you probably already know&mdash; we don&apos;t need much of an introduction, right? Or do we? Anyway, FUCK Camp is a grassroots camping festival with music and performances, created with a bunch of our friends. Camp in your tent or car, stay for two nights or just one&mdash;whatever you feel like. We will send out the location with your ticket but it&apos;s green and near Daylesford.
<br>
<br>
This mini weekend get&hyphen;away festival is all about queerdom, community, partying, celebrating us&mdash; and the freaking summer! We do want to keep things small, so this is an invite&hyphen;only festival camping weekend. We trust you cunts to invite good time types and no dickheads. We&apos;re doing this to keep things small&hyphen;ish and communal&mdash;mostly, we just want to bop with our mates, lovers and comrades.
<br>
<br>
Some people have been wondering if this is some sort of crazy sex orgy party because of the name choice, which, by the way, is nothing but creative chaos! So, yeah, it&apos;s not necessarily intended to be some push&hyphen;push&hyphen;in&hyphen;the&hyphen;bush style orgy (shout&hyphen;out to Musique)... unless you make it that. Do with that info what you will.
<br>
<br>
You&apos;re always welcome to reach out to us with any questions, and if anything is unclear, don&apos;t hesitate to <a href="mailto:fuckkamp@proton.me">contact us here.</a>
<br>
We organise space for the weekend and you cunts can bring to that space what you will. If you&apos;re iterested in performing (we don&apos;t care what it is.... interpretive dance, musicals, theatre, burlesque, poetries, drag &mdash; whatever you&apos;ve got), or making your DJ debut, send us an <a href="https://fuckkamp.gay/expressions.html"> EOI.</a>
<br>
<br>
As it&apos;s a peasant  festival, we can&apos;t pay you for shit unless you&apos;re our beloved sond and light pumpkins. But anything you bring makes the weekend better for everyone.
<br>
Also, you&apos;re more than welcome to help us on the weekend! You can help out as you see something that needs doing or you can contact us and offer your services.
<br>
Ok, now on a more personal note, we love our Naarm queers, but we know that we all have some history &mdash; whether it&apos;s with an ex, an old friend, or someone we just don&apos;t vibe with anymore. That means there&apos;s bound to be some beef, tiffs, quarrels, and squabbles here and there. We&apos;d like to encourage everyone to have a good time, and if you see someone you&apos;ve got history with, please keep it respectful and be well&hyphen;mannered. We can&apos;t promise your ex&apos;s best work friend isn&apos;t invited, or your neighbour&apos;s cousin&apos;s cat sitter who you can&apos;t stand. So, you know, let&apos;s keep things cool.
<br>
<br>
I don&apos;t think we need to mention this, but just in case: If you behave like a fuckwit, we will kindly ask you to leave or if you&apos;re too cooked to leave we&apos;ll put you in the naughty corner and are not allowed to party anymore!!!
<br>
<br>
One last thing, we like to be transparent with you about the costs. We know times are fucked and we are all we got; to make a party a good one, we don&apos;t want finances to come into play, so please feel free to payless (or nothing at all) than the ticketing price.
<br>
Oh, I promise it&apos;s the absolute last thing: Please, for our fucking sake, please clean up after yourself, this oval is very loved by the local community, so we want to leave things tidy and neat. Pick up after yourselves and your mates, bring bin bags and take your trash back home, yes, the recycling and landfill, please. OK, you are fucking ace for reading all of this!
<br>
<br>
Take care of each other. Clean up after yourself. Don&apos;t shit in the shower. Respect consent.
<br>
Love and piss,
<br>
Vika
