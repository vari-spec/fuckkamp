What is F.U.C.K Camp?
<br>
<br>
We’re a bunch of queers who love festivals, love to party, and want to make all that shit affordable and grassroots. We’re a crew of people you probably already know—we don’t need much of an introduction, right? Or do we? Anyway, FUCK Camp is a grassroots camping festival with music and performances, created with a bunch of our friends. Camp in your tent or car, stay for two nights or just one—whatever you feel like. We will send out the location with your ticket but it’s green and near Daylesford.
<br>
<br>
This mini weekend get-away festival is all about queerdom, community, partying, celebrating us—and the freaking summer! We didn’t organise crocodile slides and water squirt fights for nothing!
We do want to keep things small, so this is an invite-only festival camping weekend. If you want to bring a plus one or think someone you know would love this and make a sweet addition to our festival, please contact us first before getting an extra ticket. We’re doing this to keep things small-ish and communal—mostly, we just want to bop with our mates, lovers and comrades.
<br>
<br>
Some people have been wondering if this is some sort of crazy sex orgy party because of the name choice, which, by the way, is nothing but creative chaos! So, yeah, it’s not necessarily intended to be some push-push-in-the-bush style orgy (shout-out to Musique)... unless you make it that. Do with that info what you will.
<br>
<br>
You’re always welcome to reach out to us with any questions, and if anything is unclear, don’t hesitate to contact us here (link email address)
<br>
We have a whole weekend program planned for you but if you're interested in performing (we don’t care what it is… interpretive dance, musicals, theatre, burlesque, drag—whatever you’ve got), hosting a workshop (e.g. DIY glitter seed bombs, Yoga for people who watch cuck porn—if that’s your vibe), or making your DJ debut, send us an EOI (link to EOI) with some details about your act or music style, along with preferred day and time. Just remember, we’ve only got two days, so we can't promise we'll be able to accommodate all EOIs but we’ll do our best cause we are fucking keen to see you sweat!!!
<br>
<br>
As it’s a not-for-profit festival, we unfortunately can't pay for your contribution, but we’d love to see a bunch of passionate performances!
<br>
Also, you’re more than welcome to help us organise! We’re having committee meet-ups where we share ideas and do things like create banners and work on our soft-pillow-chill-out-zone.
<br>
Ok, now on a more personal note, we love our Naarm queers, but we know that we all have some history—whether it’s with an ex, an old friend, or someone we just don’t vibe with anymore. That means there’s bound to be some beef, tiffs, quarrels, and squabbles here and there. We’d like to encourage everyone to have a good time, and if you see someone you’ve got history with, please keep it respectful and be well-mannered. We can’t promise your ex’s best work friend isn’t invited, or your neighbour’s cousin’s cat sitter who you can’t stand. So, you know, let’s keep things cool.
<br>
<br>
I don’t think we need to mention this, but just in case: If you behave like a fuckwit, we will kindly ask you to leave or if you’re too cooked to leave we’ll put you in the naughty corner and are not allowed to party anymore!!!
<br>
<br>
One last thing, we’d like to be very transparent with you all about the costs we spent so far, here’s our budget list (add budget list). We know times are fucked and we are all we got; to make a party a good one, we don’t want finances to come into play, so please feel free to make use of our sliding scale ticketing prices, even if you can’t afford it at all at the moment, let us know and we will give you a free ticket.
Oh, I promise it’s the absolute last thing: Please, for our fucking sake, please clean up after yourself, this oval is very loved by the local community, so we want to leave things tidy and neat. Pick up after yourselves and your mates, bring bin bags and take your trash back home, yes, the recycling and landfill, please. OK, you are fucking ace for reading all of this!
<br>
<br>
Take care of each other. Clean up after yourself. Don’t shit in the shower. Respect consent.
<br>
Love and piss,
<br>
Vika
